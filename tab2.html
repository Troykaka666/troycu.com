                                        <span>Well, I don't know what to say. I am just so proud of myself for building this beautiful,
                                            responsive and awesome website. This is a upgrade to my pervious website, if you
                                            haven't visited it here is link:
                                            <a href="version1/index.html" target="_blank">version 1</a>
                                        </span>
                                        <p>When I chose Computer Science, I have not idea what I can do after I gain the degree
                                            of this major. I learnt every common programming language like: Java, C++, Python
                                            and so on, and none of them intestes me untill I saw the term "front-end-developer".</p>
                                        <p>As front-end-developers, we will focus on the UI (User Interface) mostly. Briefly, a
                                            front-end-developer is to create something everyone can see, and I like it. I want
                                            to create something everyone can see, and I want to create my idea and show it to
                                            the public. So, I now find my path to be a front-end-developer.</p>
                                        <p>The first website I built, I spent around 7hours each day, no kidding. I was never addited
                                            to something like that before, and the most amazing thing is I totally enjoyed every
                                            second I spent on it. That's unbelievable to me. I never like study this much before,
                                            everytime I learn some new tricks, it drives me crazy. Howver, I am not a smart person.
                                            So, what I learn is just to study other's code, and google any idea I have but I
                                            don't have the knowledge to do it. I just like what I do.</p>
                                        <p>Few months later in summer, I finally had enough time to start building my new website
                                            with the new knowledge I have learnt so far. Eventually, I didn't let myself down.
                                            Although this is not the best website, and it is also not functional because I have
                                            learnt PHP yet, but it is still amazing to me and I am feelling exciting.</p>
                                        <p>For the first post, I have to type something. So, here all I got. I don't know if I am
                                            good enough to earn the title of "front-end-developer", but no matter waht I will
                                            never give up on doing something I like.</p>

                                        <p>How to start it? Since nobody will read my blog anyway, so I think I just type whatever
                                            I want. Damn, it is good to own a self-built website. Oh, I finally got something
                                            to say. I have not played any pc game for two weeks now. Self-high five. Instead,
                                            I have been kept learning new stuff like PHP, Jave and so on. Every day I wake up,
                                            I just want to work-out and study. The first time, there is a voice deep down in
                                            my heart told me do not waste time on playing game, and the first time I am so desperate
                                            to study. However, this is not the first time I want to be better. I wanted to change
                                            a lot, but I gave up immediately after two or three days. I have been keeping this
                                            situation for two weeks, every time I wake up I just want to improve myself. The
                                            reason I have been so motivated all thank to a girl.</p>
                                        <p>A girl I first time saw her was in a friends picture, her smile is so beautiful which
                                            lighted up my whole goddamn universe. From that moment, I started to change. I have
                                            been kept training every day, try to lose as much weight as I could because I did
                                            not want her to see a fat nerd. Also, the moment I met her in person, I made a promise
                                            to myself: every time I see her, I will be better. I have met tons of girls, some
                                            I like, some I do not, some super cute and some smart, but this is the first girl
                                            who can motivate me everyday by her smile. I know this sound totally stupid. I know
                                            I might never get her, but it is ok if I really try. Getting a girl is secondary,
                                            I have more important things to do, like saving the world. I am just kidding. But
                                            yes, I do have more important thing to do like getting a job next semester.</p>
                                        <p>I really enjoy days like these, all I do in a day is to study or to train which makes
                                            me feel every second I spent is so meaningful. Being a single isn’t bad, because
                                            when you have something to dream of, something you want to achieve, or just something
                                            you want, every minute you spent to make those things happen which will make the
                                            single life so bright. Now, I get it. How I feel about the life depends on what attitude
                                            I have. Now, my attitude is positive. Do not care other’s words, do what I want to
                                            do, dream what I want to dream, and be the guy I want to be. There is not shame to
                                            just being myself because there is only one life, and I am going to make it legendary.
                                        </p>

                                            starts, energy fills up my entire body. OMG, I never feel so alive. It is the first
                                            time there is nothing to regret about yesterday, because every moment I spend is
                                            to do something I enjoy. Just like the “Based Zesus” said: every time you choose
                                            to do something, you also choose to how to spend your time. Time is limited, 24 hours
                                            a day, not more, not less. How to make a day countable depends on how a person what
                                            to do with his/her time.</p>
                                        <p>Wait a second! Damn it. I think I know what is wrong with me. The reason why I have been
                                            so freaking awesome maybe is not because of the girl, it is because I am eventually
                                            fucking grew up from a kid to a man, a real man. Holy shit. Okay, everything makes
                                            sense now. That’s why I don’t like playing game and I want to be a better man to
                                            express a girl, because I am a real adult now. Self-five. It never feels so good
                                            to be an adult. Even though I am 25 now, I still like hanging out with kids at YMCA
                                            center. Perhaps I look old on my age, but inside of me was still 6. I guess the age
                                            of inside me just became 7 now. Anyway, I still want to be a kid who is innocent
                                            and pure. I just hate things become complicate between me and others, it makes me
                                            sick to guess what others thinks about me, or to mad at others says about me. Now,
                                            I can totally say those words to some people: yep, I don’t give a shit about it.
                                            So get lost.</p>
                                        <p>OKOK, I should probably ignore this heavy topic. Um, let’s talk about what happen today.
                                            Well, I bathed my cats this morning. If you can read this post, that means I am still
                                            alive. Every time I try to bathe my cats, I always end up getting scratched. I should
                                            probably wear a giant coat next time. Oh, the funniest thing is after I bathed both
                                            of them, Teetee becomes mad at Momo for no reason. I just don’t get it. I am the
                                            one Tee should be mad at, but he just gets really angry at his brother. Every time
                                            when I look at Momo’s innocent eyes while he is being threaten by his brother, I
                                            feel so guilty. The good thing is momo never fights back, yep, LOVE.</p>
                                        <p>If there are some good things happen, there are always some bad things come along. I
                                            just spent 300 bucks to have my car repaired. 300$. I can buy tons of courses on
                                            Udemy or I can get myself some awesome gears like a gaming chair, or a new watch.
                                            Every time I asked the mechanic if my car is still alright, I expect he would tell
                                            me the car is dead, I should get a new one. However, reality is cruel. The mechanic
                                            told me that my car is still on very good condition, it can run for next few years
                                            without any serious issue. Damn it, the only way I can get myself a new car is to
                                            get a job after graduation. </p>
                                        <p>BTW, I just learnt how to build a post board with PHP. I am so exciting. Learning new
                                            knowledge has been so attractive to me. After I get deeper in PHP, I am going to
                                            create a membership system. So, I can offer service to people like create their own
                                            web or other stuff with their own accounts. </p>
                                        <p>Being a front-end developer is no longer my goal, because my new goal is to be a full-stack
                                            developer. Work harder, train harder, be better!!!</p>

                                    from my place which is acceptable to me. When I finally got there, I was shock by its distinctive
                                    historical colouring and flavour of the times. The favourite spot I like is the riverside
                                    street, I do jogging there every morning while I live in the Savannah</p>

                                    me to relax. I always want to visit countryside of America, and Savannah makes my dream comes

                                    independence day. My roomate suddently asked me if I wanted to go to Florida with him while
                                    I was playing game around 9PM. He said:"I will leave to Florida tomorrow morning with or
                                    without u." Then, I spent an hour packing up the stuff</p>
                                <p>David is the nicest and coolest guy I've seen because he drove all the way to Florida from my
                                    place without stop except fueling gas. After about 9hours, we settled down in a fine hotel
                                    in downtown of Miami, and then we ran straght to a square to watch the firework show. Yep,
                                    we didn't take a break because we were so freaking young and full of energy</p>
                                <p>We spent two days in Miami, then we started driving to Key West. I knew nothing about key wes.
                                    I just knew it is a southernmost city in US. While we were on the overseas highway which
                                    connects every all limestone islane, I felt like I was in a blue heaven.....</p>
                                <p>I made a promise to myself when I was standing on a beach which made of soft white sand and watching
                                    the sunset, "One Day, I will return here with my dream girl, and proposal to her". However,
                                    that day hasn't come yet</p>

                                <p>The first time I came here was with my taiwannese friend, Koan. We were good buddy back to 2012
                                    before he dumbed me and returned to Taiwan. </p>
                                <p>It was a morning in fall, koan's uncle picked me up at my apartment, and then we drove to rock
                                    city. Well,I didn't have my driver license that time. So, I barely left my apartment except
                                    going to school or grocery shopping.</p>
                                <p>Koan's uncle told me roce city is the biggest private garden in the US, and I thought that own
                                    must be the richest guy in the world. Right, eventhough he is not the richest guy in the
                                    world, he is definitely one of the happiest guy in the world. The view in rock city is unbelievable.

                                <p>New York is the first city I stayed when I just came to US. I stayed in NY for a week with my
                                    uncle and cousins.</p>
                                <p>To be honest, I don't like New York city, because it reminds me everything of my hometown. This
                                    is my first time away from my parent, it just makes me sad.</p>
                                <p>The reason I put New York here is I like the food there. As I said NY reminds me everything of
                                    my hometown, so does the food. Evetytime I go to Flushing, I spent around hundered buck to
                                    buy whatever I like. So, everytime I come back to Atlanta from NY, I gain few lbs which is
                                    a great souvenir from NY.</p>
                                <p>I haven't went to New York for a long time, and now I begin to miss the food there</p>
